Iâ€™ve always been passionate about helping people. [My colleagues and friends consider](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joseluistello/details/recommendations/) that my human quality, dedication and professionalism make me an excellent person with a top notch guidance and willingness to assist.

I have experience building, selling, managing, and analyzing projects in different industries for +3 years. Identifying problems, creating solutions, and getting sh*t done is the best part of my life. I consider myself a problem solver with systematic thinking who have a genuine passion for achieving goals. 

##### Want to know more? ðŸ¤”

I love systems, operations, processes, and strategy. Understand a company from a **systematic and strategic** approach is one of the things I enjoy the most. I'm fascinated by the process of **abstracting physical phenomenons** to the digital world. I consider that my experience and the constant effort I make to learn new disciplines have been key to understanding and excel in complex environments that exists within organizations, the systems that make them up, each process that exists and the strategies applied within the grand scheme.

##### Side-projects & interests ðŸ’¡ 

Writing, product, sales, financial modeling, software development, and data analysis are things that I enjoy to apply and learn. 

- I have a [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCshLQ0sIzkzHlhnlZN8kiVw) where I solve technical interview problems with SQL and Python. 
- I created [Simplificando la complejidad](https://simplificandola.substack.com/), a newsletter that helps me share what I learn about life and my interests.
- And I help to maintain and grow Develotron, a community focused on software engineering and professional growth.
