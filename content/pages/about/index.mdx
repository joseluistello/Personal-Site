Iâ€™ve always been passionate about software, product, data and growth. With over 3 years of experience across various industries, I excel at building, and analyzing products using differentes types of techniques and skills.

I have a deep fascination for systems, operations, processes, and strategy. Unraveling the inner workings of a company through a systematic and strategic lens is a genuine source of joy for me. I continually find myself enthralled by the process of abstracting physical phenomena into the digital world.

My interests include [writing](https://simplificandola.substack.com/), finance, and artificial intelligence. One of my favorite endeavors is creating content on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@joseluistello) about SQL and Python.
