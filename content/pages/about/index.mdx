Iâ€™ve always been passionate about software, product, data and growth. Unraveling the inner workings of a company through a systematic and strategic lens is a genuine source of joy for me. 

With over 3 years of experience across various industries, I excel at building, and analyzing products using differentes types of techniques and skills.

My interests include [writing](https://simplificandola.substack.com/), finance, and artificial intelligence. One of my favorite endeavors is creating content on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@joseluistello) about SQL and Python. 

If you have an exciting project or opportunity in mind, feel free to reach out to me at joluistello@gmail.com
